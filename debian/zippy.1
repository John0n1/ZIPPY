.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Zippy
is a colour-aware command line utility for creating, listing, testing,
repairing, and unlocking archive files. It understands ZIP, multiple TAR
variants, and single-file compression formats such as gzip, bzip2, xz, and
lzma. The application provides animated feedback, structured logging, and
password workflows powered by curated dictionaries. Optional integration with
the IpatoolR framework extends extraction, listing, and testing to
additional containers including RAR, 7z, Zstandard (and TAR.ZST), CAB, ISO,
ARJ/LZH/ACE, SIT/SITX/HQX, CPIO, Debian/RPM/APK packages, XAR/PKG bundles, and
AppImage payloads.
